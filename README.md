This project uses AngularJS. If you want to run it, make sure to install the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).

## File Structure

This is the root folder of the AngularJS "app." The main module, and all of the view components and services are in here.

### `nps-kiosk-app/src/nps`
This is the root folder of my backend code which encapsulates all of the behavior of talking to the NPS API. It is well-documented, so please take a look!
